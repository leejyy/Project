The scatterplot shows fairly random plot, which suggests no violation on linearity. In addition, if you draw two horizontal lines on the scatterplot, the width from left to right is not so different, indicating no violation of constant variance of error terms assumption. Lastly, there are no observations in which |e*| > 4 so there seems to be no outliers. Thus, based on the scatterplot, there is no suggestion of violations of assumptions. \n",
